a) Weka Models and text files with the name J48 and simpleCart are two DT classifers.
J48 uses entropy function whereas simpleCart uses Gini index as impurity function.

b) Weka models and results in RandomForest.model and RandomForest.txt. Based on the binary search for different values of K , K=100 is a reasonably good value with m=100

c) The models' results are based on 5-fold validation. Accuracy in case of RandomForest is 75.4425 % whereas in case of J48 and simpleCart , its 67.2566 % and 71.6814 % respectively.

d) i) roughfix (replacing by mean/mode)
   ii) proximity

e) look at importance.pdf for the plot of variable importance. i)Heart Rate 2)224 3)91

f) 0.2522
